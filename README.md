This project presents a detailed implementation of an automatic number plate detection system using Python and OpenCV. The core objective is to detect and extract vehicle license plates from digital images through image processing techniques and Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The process begins by importing the required libraries such as OpenCV for computer vision tasks and pytesseract for text recognition. An input image is first loaded and converted into grayscale to simplify the data and improve processing efficiency. A bilateral filter is then applied to the grayscale image to reduce noise while preserving the edges, which are crucial for locating the number plate region. The filtered image is processed using the Canny edge detector, which highlights the strong gradients or edges in the image. Next, contours are identified from the edge-detected image, and among these, the system searches for quadrilateral-shaped contours, which are most likely to represent license plates due to their rectangular nature. Once the potential license plate area is isolated, a mask is created and applied to segment the region of interest from the original image. This masked area is cropped to extract only the number plate portion. The cropped image is then passed through the Tesseract OCR engine, which reads and interprets the alphanumeric characters present on the plate. The result is the textual content of the number plate printed as output. Throughout the process, visualizations are used to display intermediate steps, such as edge maps, contour drawings, and the final segmented license plate, to aid in understanding and debugging. This system demonstrates a practical and lightweight solution for number plate recognition, which is useful in a variety of real-world applications such as traffic management, automated toll booths, parking systems, and vehicle tracking. Although the current implementation works with static images, it can be extended to process video streams or integrate with deep learning-based detection models for improved accuracy and robustness in real-time scenarios. The project serves as a foundational prototype for developers and researchers interested in computer vision applications in intelligent transportation systems.
